We had Major issues with calibrating the cameras.
Here is how we resolved it. 

First create the Proper .yaml files

part 1:

Turn on the Robolab PC -> duh..

Part 2:

cd  ~/catkin_ws/src/camera1394stereo/launch

part 3:
gedit stereo_camera.launch

part 4:

Change line 9 and line 10 with the path of the .yaml files. 

<param name="camera_info_url_left" value="file:///home/student/catkin_ws/src/camera1394stereo/launch/left.yaml" />
<param name="camera_info_url_right" value="file:///home/student/catkin_ws/src/camera1394stereo/launch/right.yaml" />

path 5:

Catkin_make the project. 


part 6:

Launch stereo_camera.launch

roslaunch camera1394stereo stereo_camera

part 7:

To apply rectification enter:

ROS_NAMESPACE=stereo_camera rosrun stereo_image_proc stereo_image_proc


in a new terminal.

part8:

Recified images can be extracted from the topic stereo_camera/{left,right}/image_rect_color

part9: 
Do the shake :P
